\subsubsection{Abstraction}
A level of abstraction was implemented between the ACO or GA method of finding an optimal combination and the evaluation of the combination. This is because the genome of the ants and the genotypes in the GA are the same quadruples of strategies. This allowed for more code to be reused. Both GA and ACO produce candidate solutions which are abstracted using an interface called \texttt{StrategySolution}, and the GA and ACO methods implement a \texttt{StrategyOptimizer} interface.

The robot which implements each solution for the purposes of calculating fitness only uses the \texttt{StrategySolution} interface which supports a method for returning the solution by a method call \texttt{getSolution()} which returns an integer array describing the selected strategies. This array contains exactly four values. Each value identifies a specific strategy. First first number in the array defines a movement strategy, the second defines a firing strategy, the third defines a radar movement strategy, and the last defines a gun movement strategy. Every strategy was simply a pre-programmed function which took as input the robots current knowledge and returned the next set of actions the robot should perform. The solution space contained all possible combinations of strategies for each of the four aforementioned classes. The solution classes were programmed to be completely modular; movement strategies only controlled the robot's movement, radar movement strategies only controlled the radars movement, et cetera. Clearly this is the same process as that used by Hong and Cho \cite{emergentbehaviours}. We have made some modifications to their method. Firstly, we allowed a strategy to access all the data with which the robot has access. We also removed the target selection strategy as we are only focussing on one versus one battles. We also removed the `avoid' strategies. A summary of the strategies we implemented can be found in Table \ref{table:strategies}.
