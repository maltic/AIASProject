\subsubsection{Abstraction}
A level of abstraction was implemented between the ACO or GA method of finding an optimal combination and the evaluation of the combination. This is because the genome of the ants and the genotypes in the GA are the same quadruples of strategies. This allowed for more code to be reused.
