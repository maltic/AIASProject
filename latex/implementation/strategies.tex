\subsubsection{Abstraction}
A level of abstraction was implemented between the ACO or GA method of finding an optimal combination and the evaluation of the combination. This is because the genome of the ants and the genotypes in the GA are the same quadruples of strategies. This allowed for more code to be reused. Both GA and ACO produce candidate solutions which are abstracted using an interface called \texttt{StrategySolution}, and the GA and ACO methods implement a \texttt{StrategyOptimizer} interface.

The robot which implements each solution for the purposes of calculating fitness only uses the \texttt{StrategySolution} interface which supports a method for returning the solution by a method call \texttt{getSolution()} which returns an integer array describing the selected strategies.
