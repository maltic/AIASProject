\subsection{Applicability of Neuroevolution to Training Robots}
It was found as a result of our investigation holistic Neuroevolution was not able to learn a successful Robot function in a reasonable amount of time. We recommend extra abstractions and modularization of the code of the Robot in order to improve the training time and fitness.

\subsection{Strategy Learning}
Both GA and ACO seem equally proficient in combining modular strategies to win one versus one robot battles. Furthermore, Neurotuning also seems to provide some benefit against specific opponents. 

No problems were encountered in the trials performed. It is expected if a robot fails to beat the enemy, then the number of pre-defined strategies must be expanded.

The GA and ACO appear to require the same resources and therefore either method is applicable to learning a combination of strategies.

\subsection{Future Work}
After modularizing the Neuroevolution learning, the GA and ACO can be applied to learning good combinations of the learned modular strategies.
