Neuroevolution is a population-based technique for learning the weights of an artificial neural network.  The Neuroevolution method used is a direct representation. This means the genomes in the genetic algorithm map directly to the neural network. Our genomes were simply a vector of real numbers which represent the weights of the neural network. This straightforward representation has the advantage of being easy to code and easy to train. This technique, however, only works with a good initial network topology because the genetic algorithm cannot change the structure of the neural network.
