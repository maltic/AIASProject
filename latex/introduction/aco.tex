ACO is a metaheuristic inspired on the foraging behaviour of Argentine ants. Our ACO is based loosely on the Max-Min Ant System in \cite{stutzle2000max}. We keep a finite population of ants which walk through a graph representing the solution space of the problem. The way these ants choose nodes is the first important feature that makes ACO an effective algorithm. The second is the simulation of ants laying down pheromone.
